# Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Memory allocation done at the time of execution(run time) is known as dynamic memory allocation. Functions calloc() and malloc() support allocating dynamic memory.

- Dynamic memory allocation in C/C++ refers to performing memory allocation manually by a programmer. Dynamically allocated memory is allocated on Heap and non-static and local variables get memory allocated on Stack.
