# Inline Functions 
- This are like list comprehension or lambda functions( NOT SURE). 
- If the code is of 1 line then compiler will definitely make the function inline.
- If the code inside function is of 2-3 lines, then it depends on compiler whether to make it inline or not.
- If the code is >3 lines, then compiler won't take it as inline function and will disregard your declaration.
