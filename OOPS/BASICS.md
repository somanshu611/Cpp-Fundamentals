- Macros are a piece of code in a program that is given some name. Whenever the compiler encounters this name, the compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code. The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro.

- **Note**: There is no semicolon(‘;’) at the end of the macro definition.

- **Macros with arguments**: We can also pass arguments to macros. Macros defined with arguments work similarly as functions.

```
#define Area(l, b)(l * b)
```
